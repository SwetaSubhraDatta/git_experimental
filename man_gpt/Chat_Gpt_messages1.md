List out all the functionalities of git config

## Genie

Certainly! Here are some of the main functionalities of `git config`:

- **Setting user information:** You can use `git config` to set your name and email address, which will be associated with any commits you make. For example: 

  ```
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
  ```

- **Setting aliases:** You can create shortcuts for commonly used Git commands using aliases. For example:

  ```
  git config --global alias.co checkout
  git config --global alias.br branch
  ```

- **Configuring editor preferences:** You can set your preferred text editor for Git to use when opening commit messages or other files. For example:

  ```
  git config --global core.editor "nano"
  ```

- **Managing remote repositories:** You can configure settings related to remote repositories, such as the URL of the remote repository and the default branch to use. For example:

  ```
  git config --global remote.origin.url "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git"
  git config --global remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
  ```

These are just a few examples of what you can do with `git config`. There are many more options available - you can see a full list in the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config).

Sure, here are some more functionalities of `git config`:

- **Setting merge and diff tools:** You can configure which external tools Git should use for merging and diffing files. For example:

  ```
  git config --global merge.tool "meld"
  git config --global diff.tool "vimdiff"
  ```

- **Configuring line endings:** You can set how Git handles line endings in your repository. For example:

  ```
  git config --global core.autocrlf true
  ```

- **Setting up Git hooks:** You can configure Git to run custom scripts before or after certain actions, such as committing or pushing changes. For example:

  ```
  git config core.hooksPath /path/to/custom/hooks
  ```

- **Configuring Git output:** You can customize the output that Git produces when running commands. For example:

  ```
  git config --global color.ui true
  git config --global pager.branch false
  ```

These are just a few more examples of what you can do with `git config`. As I mentioned earlier, there are many more options available - you can see a full list in the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config).

Sure, here are some more Git commands and functionalities:

- **`git stash`:** This command allows you to temporarily save changes that you don't want to commit yet. You can then apply these changes later using `git stash apply`.

- **`git cherry-pick`:** This command allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. For example, if you want to apply a bug fix from a release branch to

give me more functionaliteis of git config

## Genie

Certainly, here are some more functionalities of `git config`:

1. **Setting user information:** You can use `git config` to set your name and email address that will be associated with your commits. This is important because Git uses this information to identify the author of a commit. Here's an example command to set your name and email:

   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
   ```

2. **Setting aliases:** You can use `git config` to create shortcuts for commonly used Git commands. For example, you can create an alias for `git status` by running the following command:

   ```
   git config --global alias.st status
   ```

   Now, instead of typing `git status`, you can simply type `git st`.

3. **Configuring merge and diff tools:** You can use `git config` to configure the merge and diff tools that Git uses. For example, you can configure Git to use a graphical merge tool like `meld` by running the following command:

   ```
   git config --global merge.tool meld
   ```

4. **Setting default branch name:** You can use `git config` to set the default branch name for new repositories. For example, if you want to use `main` as the default branch name, you can run the following command:

   ```
   git config --global init.defaultBranch main
   ```

5. **Viewing configuration settings:** You can use `git config` to view all the configuration settings for your Git installation. Simply run the following command:

   ```
   git config --list
   ```

These are just a few examples of the many functionalities of `git config`.

Generate ssh key on Windows

## Genie

Sure, here are the steps to generate an SSH key on Windows:

1. Open Git Bash: Click on the Start menu and search for "Git Bash". Click on the Git Bash icon to open it.

2. Run the ssh-keygen command: In the Git Bash terminal window, run the following command to generate a new SSH key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   Replace `your_email@example.com` with your email address.

3. Choose a file location and name: The command will prompt you to choose a file location and name for your SSH key. You can press Enter to accept the default location and name, or specify a different location and name if you prefer.

4. Choose a passphrase (optional): The command will also prompt you to enter a passphrase for your SSH key. This is optional, but recommended for added security. If you choose to use a passphrase, make sure to remember it or store it in a secure location.

5. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account: Once you have generated your SSH key, you need to add it to your GitHub account. To do this, copy the contents of the public key file (the one ending in `.pub`) to your clipboard. Then, go to your GitHub account settings, click on "SSH and GPG keys", and click on "New SSH key". Paste the contents of the public key file into the "Key" field, give the key a descriptive title, and click "Add SSH key".

That's it! You have now generated an SSH key on Windows and added it to your GitHub account.

How to have two github accounts on a single Windows machine

## Genie

To use two GitHub accounts on a single Windows machine, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new SSH key for the second GitHub account: Open `cmd.exe` and run the following command to create a new SSH key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   Replace `your_email@example.com` with the email address associated with your second GitHub account. When prompted to enter a file location and name for the key, choose a different location and name than the one used for your first GitHub account.

2. Add the new SSH key to your second GitHub account: Copy the contents of the public key file (the one ending in `.pub`) to your clipboard. Then, go to your second GitHub account settings, click on "SSH and GPG keys", and click on "New SSH key". Paste the contents of the public key file into the "Key" field, give the key a descriptive title, and click "Add SSH key".

3. Create a new SSH config file: In `cmd.exe`, navigate to your user directory by running the following command:

   ```
   cd %userprofile%
   ```

   Then, create a new file called `config` in the `.ssh` directory by running the following command:

   ```
   notepad .ssh\config
   ```

4. Configure the SSH config file: In the Notepad window that opens, add the following lines to the file:

   ```
   # Default GitHub account
   Host github.com
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

   # Second GitHub account
   Host github-second-account
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_second_account
   ```

   Replace `id_rsa_second_account` with the name of the private key file you created in step 1.

5. Clone repositories using the new SSH config: When cloning a repository from your second GitHub account, use the following command:

   ```
   git clone git@github-second-account:<username>/<repository>.git
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with your second GitHub account username and `<repository>` with the name of the repository you want to clone.

That's it! You can now use two GitHub accounts on a single Windows machine by configuring a separate SSH key and SSH config file for each account.
